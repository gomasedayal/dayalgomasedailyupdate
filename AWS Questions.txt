1. What is AWS?
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a comprehensive and widely adopted cloud platform offered by Amazon. 
It provides a range of cloud services such as computing power, storage options, and networking capabilities. 
AWS enables businesses and developers to deploy, manage, and scale applications without the need for physical hardware.

What are the key services provided by AWS?
AWS offers numerous services categorized into different domains. Some of the key services include:

Compute: Amazon EC2, AWS Lambda
Storage: Amazon S3, Amazon EBS
Databases: Amazon RDS, Amazon DynamoDB
Networking: Amazon VPC, Amazon Route 53
Analytics: Amazon EMR, Amazon Redshift

What is an EC2 instance?
Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. 
An EC2 instance is a virtual server in Amazon’s Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for running applications on the AWS infrastructure.

How do you launch an EC2 instance?
To launch an EC2 instance:

Open the Amazon EC2 console.
Click “Launch Instance.”
Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI).
Select an instance type based on your requirements.
Configure instance details, such as the number of instances and network settings.
Add storage by specifying the size and type of the volume.
Configure security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic.
Review and launch the instance.
Create or select an existing key pair for SSH access.

What is S3 in AWS?
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a scalable object storage service that allows users to store and retrieve any amount of 
data at any time from anywhere on the web. It is designed for 99.999999999% (11 nines) durability.

Explain the difference between S3 and EBS.

S3 (Simple Storage Service): Object storage service, used for storing and retrieving any amount of data. 
                             It is highly durable and accessible over the internet.

EBS (Elastic Block Store):   Block storage service, used as storage volumes for EC2 instance


What are the benefits of using AWS?

Scalability: Easily scale resources up or down as needed.
Cost-effective: Pay only for the resources you use.
Security: Offers robust security features and compliance certifications.
Flexibility: Wide range of services and tools to build and manage applications.
Global Reach: Availability zones in multiple regions worldwide.


What is AWS Lambda?
AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. 
You can run your code in response to events, such as changes to data in an S3 bucket or an update to a DynamoDB table.

What is an AMI?
An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a pre-configured template for an EC2 instance that contains the information required 
to launch an instance. This includes the operating system, application server, and applications.

What is Auto Scaling?
Auto Scaling is an AWS service that automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances in response to changing application demand. 
This ensures that you have the right number of instances running to handle the current load on your application.

Example:
You can configure an Auto Scaling group to automatically add more EC2 instances when the CPU utilization exceeds a specified threshold, 
and remove instances when the utilization drops below the threshold.

Explain the different types of load balancers in AWS.
AWS offers three types of load balancers:

Application Load Balancer (ALB): Operates at the application layer (HTTP/HTTPS), ideal for web applications.
Network Load Balancer (NLB): Operates at the transport layer (TCP/UDP), suited for high-performance and low-latency applications.
Classic Load Balancer (CLB): Operates at both the application and transport layers, used for applications built within the EC2-Classic network.

What is Amazon RDS?
Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) is a managed database service that simplifies the setup, operation, and scaling of relational 
databases in the cloud. It supports multiple database engines, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.

What is the difference between RDS and DynamoDB?
Amazon RDS: A managed relational database service supporting structured query language (SQL) databases.
Amazon DynamoDB: A managed NoSQL database service designed for fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability.

What is AWS Snowball?
AWS Snowball is a data transport solution that uses secure physical devices to transfer large amounts of data into and out of AWS. 
It helps with data migration, disaster recovery, and content distribution.

Example:
A company can use Snowball to move petabytes of data from their on-premises data center to AWS without using the internet, significantly 
reducing transfer times.
